# Balancing-Robot
Buddy, a balancing robot for ECE 4180 Finals Project

Group members: Sidhant Gulati, Muath Alsubh. Fan Han Hoon, Daniel Niemann

Brief Description of Design Project:
Our project is a balancing robot that uses an IMU to figure out its orientation and automatically corrects its
position so that it does not fall over. We plan to use MBED multi-threading and RTOS.
A balancing robot requires fast error calculation and a PID controller to balance it. This can run on one of 
the threads while all other functions such as Ultrasonic sensor, LEDs, Speakers etc.

List of Features
1) 3D printed Chassis
2) IMU
3) Two regular geared motors
4) Motor Driver
5) Battery
6) Mbed
7) LEDs
8) Power Switch

List of Features if we have enough time.
1) Ultrasonic Sensor
2) Multiple Modes – Dancing, Explorer, 
Tracking
3) Bluetooth Control
4) Speakers
5) Line Follower

If you need any parts or software not available in the lab or in your parts kit, what is your plan to obtain the 
parts quickly (within 10 days)? – With the current virus issues, I would recommend using only what is 
already available in the lab this term, since ordering and shipping may be disrupted.
We plan on 3D printing the chassis
We are ordering a new IMU sensor
We need soldering services from the HIVE as well as Prototyping board
