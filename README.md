Buddy, a balancing robot for ECE 4180 Finals Project

Group members: Sidhant Gulati, Muath Alsubh. Fan Han Hoon, Daniel Niemann

## Overview
This repository contains all the necessary code, documentation, and resources for building a self-balancing robot. The robot uses an LSM9DS0 sensor for motion sensing and an mbed microcontroller for processing and control. Additional features include Bluetooth connectivity for remote control and an HC-SR04 Sonar Sensor for distance measurement.

## Features
- Self-balancing capabilities using gyroscope and accelerometer data.
- Bluetooth control via Adafruit Bluefruit LE UART Friend.
- Obstacle detection using HC-SR04 Sonar Sensor.
- Customizable and expandable design.


## Brief Description of Design Project:
The Self-Balancing Robot project is an advanced robotics initiative aimed at designing and constructing a robot that can autonomously maintain its balance in real-time. Utilizing a combination of motion-sensing technology, precision control algorithms, and mechanical engineering, this robot represents a confluence of various fields of STEM.

## Design Objectives

- Stability: To engineer a robot that can stand upright on two wheels, adjusting its position dynamically to counteract forces that might cause it to topple.
- Control: Integration of a PID (Proportional, Integral, Derivative) control system to process real-time data from motion sensors and adjust motor responses accordingly.
- Connectivity and Interaction: Implement Bluetooth technology for remote control capabilities and a sonar sensor for obstacle detection and navigation.

## Components
The following components are required to build the robot:

If you need any parts or software not available in the lab or in your parts kit, what is your plan to obtain the 
parts quickly (within 10 days)? â€“ With the current virus issues, I would recommend using only what is 
already available in the lab this term, since ordering and shipping may be disrupted.
We plan on 3D printing the chassis
We are ordering a new IMU sensor
We need soldering services from the HIVE as well as Prototyping board
